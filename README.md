# LunchSquadApp
LunchSquad is an application used by all employees. Users may find restaurants nearby and share a restaurant choice with co-workers. Users can check out where co-workers are headed for lunch and decide if they'd like to go with them. Just before the lunch break, the app sends push notifications to attending users and and invite them to join their co-workers. Code is Java and backend db is via Cloud Firestore.
